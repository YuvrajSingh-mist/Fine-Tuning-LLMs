# Fine-Tuning LLMs using LoRA and QLoRA techniques

A repository consisting of my notebooks used to fine-tune different LLMs on various tasks and datasets from HuggingFace.

All of my custom fine-tuned LLMs models can be found at my [HuggingFace account](https://huggingface.co/YuvrajSingh9886) 

All the local set-up procedures are provided in the respective folder of the above models alongside other details.
